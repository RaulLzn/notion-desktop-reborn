### How Tab System Works

1. **Visual tab bar** appears at the top of the window showing all open tabs ✅
2. **Auto-adapts to theme**: Tab bar automatically switches between light and dark theme ✅
3. **Click any tab** to switch to that page instantly ✅
4. **Click the + button** or use Ctrl+T to create a new tab ✅
5. **Click the × button** on any tab to close it (except the last tab) ✅
6. When you click **"Open in new tab"** in Notion, it creates a new tab in the same window ✅
7. Each tab runs independently with its own browsing context ✅
8. **Scrollbars match theme**: Both horizontal and vertical scrollbars adapt to dark/light theme ✅
9. The window title shows the current tab title and position (e.g., "Page Title (2/3) - Notion") ✅
10. Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between tabs ✅

### All Features Working ✅

The application now provides a complete desktop experience for Notion with:
- **Full tab management system** with visual interface
- **Native keyboard shortcuts** for all common operations
- **Automatic theme synchronization** between tab bar and content
- **Seamless integration** with Notion's interface
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (optimized for Linux)
